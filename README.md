# ERM Tutor RAG Chatbot with Langchain

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an ERM Tutor AI, a domain-specific application that combines the strengths of a large language model (LLM) with the efficiency of a vector database for data storage and retrieval. The application is built with Python using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for the method and Streamlit** for the front end.

## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for building the user interface.
- **Vector Database**: Chroma DB and later PineCone
- **LLM**: OpenAI model for natural language processing and query handling.
- **Backend**: LangChain framework utilizing the RAG method.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains Python-based chatbot script and Streamlit main script.
- **src/materials/**: Contains data that our model will use to answer questions.
- **.env**: Contains API keys.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- langchain
- pinecone-client
- python-dotenv
- streamlit
- pypdf
